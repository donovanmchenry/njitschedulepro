# NJIT Schedule Pro - Project Summary

## Overview
A production-ready, full-stack web application that generates optimal course schedules for NJIT students using constraint-based solving. The system processes multiple CSV files containing course data and produces all valid schedule combinations that respect user-defined constraints.

6. **Advanced Filters**: More delivery mode options, building preferences
7. **Share Schedules**: Generate shareable links
8. **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android apps
9. **Email Alerts**: Notify when seats open in desired sections
10. **Historical Data**: Track enrollment trends

## Development Workflow

2. Start backend: `cd api && poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
3. Start frontend: `cd web && pnpm dev`
4. Or use Docker: `docker compose up`
